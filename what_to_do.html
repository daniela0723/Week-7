        Spring Break and over the winter holidays. The town is

        called
        <em>Expo Tortuga</em> in which participants can help release baby sea turtles into the sea. This even is meant
        to
        raise awareness about this endangered species.

    <h3><em>Barra de Pichi</em></h3>
    <p>En route to <em>Playa Azul</em> there is a crocodile-infested estuary called <em>Barra de
